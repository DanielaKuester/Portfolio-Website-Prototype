                <p>Hi, I'm Daniela. My passion is to build interactive, responsive and accessible websites!</p>
                <p>
                    I received a <a href="https://grow.google/intl/europe">Grow With Google</a> Scholarship and graduated from 
                    <a href="https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001">Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree</a>.
                    I'm constantly striving to improve my coding skills. At the moment, I learn a lot about CSS and JavaScript.
                    I also love working with ReactJS and I'm looking forward to explore more JavaScript frameworks!
                </p>
                <p>"Never stop learning" is my life motto.</p>

                        <p>
                            The Animal Trading Card was the first little Udacity project that included HTML <em>and</em> CSS.
                            In this project, I explored some basics of CSS like borders, the border-radius and shadows.
                            I also discovered my love for linear gradients. I just <em>had</em> to include them in this Portfolio Website, too.
                            So: Now you know where that preference comes from.

                        <p>
                            The Portfolio Website was the first a bit more complex Udacity project with HTML and CSS. For this project, Udacity gave us a mockup of
                            a portfolio and the task was to recreate it while giving it a personal touch. It's also the first project that involves
                            responsive design and adapts to different screen widths (on PCs, tablets, phablets and smartphones).

                            The Udacity Portfolio Website project contains links to my very first experiments with programming, like for example the CSS styling
                            of an article about IBM's AI Deep Blue, the Animal Trading Card project and a Pixel Art Maker. In the future, I will rework (and hopefully
                            refine) this project and I'll post updates here. For example, the navigation bar will be fixed to the top. ;)

                        <p>
                            For this project, I built a Memory Game (also called 'Concentration') with JavaScript. The starter code provided me with a basic
                            CSS styling and a shuffle method. The main challenge was to make the static website come alive with some JavaScript magic.
                            I didn't necessarily have to add animation to the cards, but I think that it gives the game a nice touch.

                            In the future, I also want to add sounds to the game. Of all projects, the Memory Game is my favourite project
                            because I learned the first basics of JavaScript debugging with the Chrome Developer tools.
                            Through the Memory Game project, I came to love the power of event listeners and DOM manipulation.

                        <p>
                            The lessons leading to the Arcade Game Clone project introduced the principles of object oriented programming and
                            the Frogger clone is the first project where I applied these principles. The encapsulation principle, the separation
                            of concerns and the use of prototypes were big challenges for me, but I'm looking forward to learning more about object
                            oriented programming since it will also help me to improve my ReactJS skills.

                        <p>
                            For this project, I applied the red to green testing principles to an existing Feed Reader website.
                            The tests include that all articles load and update properly, and the menu changes visibility when the corresponding icon is clicked.
                            It was fascinating to experience how good testing methods can improve the development process when creating a new project.
                            I definitely want to dive deeper into testing!

                        <p>
                            The challenges of the Restaurant Reviews App were to fix the given CSS file to make the website responsive, to adhere to modern
                            accessibility standards and to add a service worker for offline use. Implementing the service worker was difficult for me in the beginning,
                            so I followed a tutorial, but I'm planning to write my own version of a service worker in the future.

                        <p>
                            The MyReads Book Tracking App is the first of my projects written with ReactJS. It was quite a challenge for me to grasp
                            the basic concepts of React and to <em>apply</em> them to a project, but it turned out a lot better than expected and I even started to
                            like React. I'll probably use some CSS to give the project a more modern look in the future. I also want to remove redundant code
                            so that the project adheres to the DRY principle (<strong>D</strong>on't <strong>R</strong>epeat <strong>Y</strong>ourself).
